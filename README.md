# ResNet18 Pre-trained Model for Custom 15-Class Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained ResNet18 model for classifying a custom dataset with 15 classes. It leverages transfer learning to adapt a powerful, pre-trained model to a specific classification task.

## Features

- Utilizes the ResNet18 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
- Adapts the model for a custom 15-class classification task
- Implements transfer learning techniques
- Provides scripts for data loading, model training, and evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/kap2403/resnet18-pretrained-model-for-classifying-custom-dataset-of-15-classes.git

## Model Architecture

This project uses ResNet18, a convolutional neural network that is 18 layers deep. The pre-trained model is modified to output 15 classes instead of the original 1000 ImageNet classes.
